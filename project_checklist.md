    - [ ] How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?
    - [ ] How should performance be measured?
    - [ ] Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
    - [ ]  What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objec‚Äê tive?
