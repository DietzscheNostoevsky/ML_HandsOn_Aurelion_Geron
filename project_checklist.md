    - [ ] What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?
    - [ ] How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?
    - [ ] How should performance be measured?
    - [ ] Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
    - [ ] 7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objec‚Äê tive?
