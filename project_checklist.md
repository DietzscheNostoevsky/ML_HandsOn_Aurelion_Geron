# **Machine Learning Project Checklist**

# Checklist 

- [x] (for checked checkbox)
- [ ] (for unchecked checkbox) 
- [ ] ***1.  Frame the problem and look at the bigger picture***
    - [ ] Define the objective in business terms
    - [ ] How will your solution be used?
    - [ ] What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?
    - [ ] How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?
    - [ ] How should performance be measured?
    - [ ] Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
    - [ ] What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objec‚Äê tive?
    - [ ] What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?
    - [ ] Is human expertise available?
    - [ ] How would you solve the problem manually?
    - [ ] List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far. 
    - [ ] Verify assumptions if possible.


- [ ] ***2. Get the Data***

    - [ ] List the data you need and how much you need.
    - [ ] Find and document where you can get that data.
    - [ ] Check how much space it will take.
    - [ ] Check legal obligations, and get authorization if necessary. 
    - [ ] Get access authorizations.
    - [ ] Create a workspace (with enough storage space).
    - [ ] Get the data.
    - [ ] Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself).
    - [ ] Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g., anonymized). 
    - [ ] Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.). 
    - [ ] Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!).
  
- [ ] ***3. Explore the Data to gain insights***

- [ ] ***4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to ML algos***
- [ ] ***5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best*** ones 
- [ ] ***6. Fine tune the model and combine them into a solution***
- [ ] ***7. Present the solution***
- [ ] ***8. Launch, monitor and maintain the system***
