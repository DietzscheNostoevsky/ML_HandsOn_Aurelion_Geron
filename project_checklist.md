# **Machine Learning Project Checklist**

# Checklist 

- [x] (for checked checkbox)
- [ ] (for unchecked checkbox) 
- [ ] ***1.  Frame the problem and look at the bigger picture***
    - [ ] Define the objective in business terms
    - [ ] How will your solution be used?
    - [ ] What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?
    - [ ] How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)?
    - [ ] How should performance be measured?
    - [ ] Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
    - [ ]  What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objec‐ tive?
    - [ ]  What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?
    - [ ]  Is human expertise available?
    - [ ]  How would you solve the problem manually?
    - [ ]  List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far. 
    - [ ]  Verify assumptions if possible.


- [ ] ***2. Get the Data***

    - [ ] List the data <font size=”1”> you need and how much you need.<font>
    - [ ] Find and document <font size=”3”> where you can get that data<font>.
    - [ ] Check how much space it will take.
1. Check legal obligations, and get authorization if necessary. 5. Get access authorizations.
2. Create a workspace (with enough storage space).
3. Get the data.
4. Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself).
5. Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g., anonymized). 10. Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.). 11. Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!).
- [ ] ***3. Explore the Data to gain insights***
- [ ] ***4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to ML algos***
- [ ] ***5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best*** ones 
- [ ] ***6. Fine tune the model and combine them into a solution***
- [ ] ***7. Present the solution***
- [ ] ***8. Launch, monitor and maintain the system***
